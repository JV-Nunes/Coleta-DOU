### Automated and filtered collection of the Federal Official Gazette

The purpose of this project is to automate the collection of the Official Gazette by publishing its filtered content on the Slack platform.
The collection is carried out through 'basedosdados.org', daily. From this dataset, the code will implement the appropriate filters in the Journal and publish them to Slack via a BOT in the defined workspace.
